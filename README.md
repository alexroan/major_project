# University Project (2013)

An old university project built in 2012-2013.

Based on a similar idea to [BlaBlaCar](https://www.blablacar.co.uk/). Users are able to post journeys they will be driving, and other users can request to hitch a ride.

Google Directions APIs are used to find journey matches and partial journeys.
